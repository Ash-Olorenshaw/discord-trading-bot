# Discord Trading Bot

### written by Asher Olorenshaw

This is a simple Discord bot that attempts to vaguely emulate a real-world stockmarket.
Each day it will update item values that are in the "prices.txt" file and then generate a selection of items which are purchasable for that day.
Item values are graphed for users to see upon request.
Users will have their items' worth calculated each day in a networth which they can also access and have graphed for them.

For information on available commands inside the bot, run '-s help'
